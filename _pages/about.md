Hello! I am Sumukh Aithal and I am a final year Computer Science undergraduate student studying at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu) in India.
I am broadly interested in deep learning. Specifically, I like to work on Out-of-Distribution generalization and robustness mainly in the context of computer vision. I am interested in understanding how human perception is different from computer vision in the context of generalization and robustness. \\
I am currently a research intern at [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Science where I am fortunate to be working under the supervision of [Prof. R Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/).
