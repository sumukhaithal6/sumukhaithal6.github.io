Hello! I am a final year MSML student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I am advised by Prof. Zico Kolter [Prof. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/). Before joining CMU, I worked as an Applied Researcher II at [Fujitsu Research India](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/research/). I completed my undergraduate studies at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu) in 2022 with a major in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am broadly interested in deep learning and computer vision. Recently, I spent some time working as a research intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) with [Anirudh Goyal](https://anirudh9119.github.io/) closely collaborating with [Alex Lamb](https://sites.google.com/view/alexmlamb) and [Michael Mozer](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php). Before that, I was a research intern at [Vision and AI Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science for two years where I was fortunate to be working under the supervision of [Prof. R Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/).

Refer to the [Publications](https://sumukhaithal6.github.io/publications/) section for the list of my publications and research.
