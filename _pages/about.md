Hello! I am currently working as a Applied Researcher II at [Fujitsu Research India](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/research/) where I am tackling research problems in Non-Euclidean Learning (Graph Neural Networks). I recently completed my undergraduate study at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu) with a major in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am broadly interested in deep learning and computer vision. Recently, I spent some time working as a research intern at Mila with [Anirudh Goyal](https://anirudh9119.github.io/) closely collaborating with [Alex Lamb](https://sites.google.com/view/alexmlamb) and [Michael Mozer](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php). Before that, I was a research intern at [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science for two years where I was fortunate to be working under the supervision of [Prof. R Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/).

Refer to the [Publications](https://sumukhaithal6.github.io/publications/) section for the list of my publications and research.

<!-- I am broadly interested in deep learning. Specifically, I like to work on Out-of-Distribution generalization and robustness mainly in the context of computer vision. I am interested in understanding how human perception is different from computer vision in the context of generalization and robustness. \\ -->
