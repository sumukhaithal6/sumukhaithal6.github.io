### One Sentence Summary
Performed Semantic Segmentation on the Indian Driving Dataset using custom trained DeepLabV3+ network and worked on low light enhancement techniques to improve the model’s accuracy.
## Problem Statement
To enhance the vision of the driver with smart algorithms that can work in low light scenarios – dusk, night, in lights from headlights etc.
The solution should be able to detect common objects like cars, two-wheelers, auto rickshaws, pedestrians, riders in the night/low-light conditions.
The system has been developed to work in the visible spectrum.
